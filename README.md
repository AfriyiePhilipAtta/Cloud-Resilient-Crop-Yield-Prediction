# 🌾 AI and Remote Sensing for Cloud-Resilient Crop Yield Prediction

## 🌍 Overview

A dual-model machine learning pipeline for predicting crop yields using fused Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (SAR) satellite imagery, combined with environmental variables. The system integrates Google Earth Engine (GEE) for satellite data retrieval, Kalman filtering for image fusion, and XGBoost for yield prediction, producing both plot-level yield estimates and pixel-by-pixel spatial yield maps.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The pipeline uses a **dual-model design** to separate concerns between plot-level accuracy and spatial mapping.

### 🔬 Model 1 — Plot-Level Yield Model

Used for training, cross-validation, uncertainty estimation, and the confidence CSV output.

| Feature Group | Features |
|---|---|
| 🌿 Vegetation Index (VI) | `NDVI_fused_auc` |
| 📡 SAR / Sentinel-1 (S1) | `VV_mean`, `VH_mean` |
| 🌍 Environmental (ENV) | `rainfall`, `soil_organic_carbon`, `clay_content`, `temp` |
| **Total** | **7 features** |

### 🗺️ Model 2 — Within-Field Variability Model

Used exclusively for pixel-by-pixel spatial yield map generation. ENV features are intentionally excluded because they are spatially constant at the field scale and would suppress within-field variability.

| Feature Group | Features |
|---|---|
| 🛰️ Spatial (VI + S1) | `NDVI_fused_mean`, `VV_mean`, `VH_mean` |
| **Total** | **3 features** |

## 🛰️ NDVI: S2-Only vs Kalman-Fused S2+S1

The figure below compares raw Sentinel-2 NDVI (left column) against Kalman-fused S2+S1 NDVI (right column) across all three growth stages at farm boundary level. The fused output recovers cloud-contaminated pixels using SAR backscatter, producing a spatially complete NDVI field.

![Farm NDVI Comparison — S2-Only vs Kalman-Fused, All Growth Stages](output_dfh/FARM_NDVI_Comparison_ALL_STAGES.png)

> **Key observation:** S2-only images show uniform low NDVI (deep red) where cloud gaps exist. Kalman fusion restores meaningful spatial variation, particularly visible in the Early and Mid stages where cloud cover is highest.

## 🎯 Validation — Predicted vs Observed

### All Growth Stages (Multi-Panel)

The scatter plots below show predicted vs reported yield (t/ha) for all 28 plots across each growth stage. The diagonal line represents perfect prediction (1:1). Points above the line indicate underprediction; points below indicate overprediction.

![Predicted vs Observed — All Three Growth Stages](output_dfh/Predicted_vs_Observed_3STAGES_multipanel.png)

### Best Stage — LATE (Single Panel)

The Late stage achieves the best validation performance (Val R² = 0.172, Val RMSE = 1.186 t/ha). The large train–val R² gap (Train R² = 0.709 vs Val R² = 0.172) indicates overfitting consistent with the small sample size (n=28 plots).

## 📉 Yield Change Between Stages

### Mid → Early (Mid stage minus Early stage)

Mean change: −0.04 t/ha | Std: 0.12 t/ha | Pixels increasing: 2.4% | Pixels decreasing: 21.9%

Red indicates yield increase from Early to Mid; blue indicates yield decrease. The dominant blue signal shows that most of the field experienced a slight yield decline between Early and Mid stage predictions.

![Yield Change — Mid minus Early](output_dfh/YieldMap_Difference_MID_minus_EARLY.png)

### Late → Mid (Late stage minus Mid stage)

Mean change: +0.09 t/ha | Std: 0.19 t/ha | Pixels increasing: 27.4% | Pixels decreasing: 3.5%

The dominant red signal shows that most of the field experienced yield recovery from Mid to Late stage, consistent with crop maturation during the July–August window.

## 🔬 Methodology Notes

### ☁️ Cloud Masking

Sentinel-2 images are filtered using the Scene Classification Layer (SCL). Only clear-sky pixels (SCL classes 4 = vegetation, 5 = bare soil, 6 = water) are retained. Cloudy pixels remain as genuine gaps — no artificial filling is applied.

### 🔀 Kalman Fusion

For each growth stage, a pixel-wise weighted average blends S2 NDVI (high spatial detail) and S1 RVI (cloud-penetrating SAR) using their respective variance as weights:

```
w_S2       = σ²_S1 / (σ²_S1 + σ²_S2)
w_S1       = σ²_S2 / (σ²_S1 + σ²_S2)
NDVI_fused = w_S2 × NDVI_S2 + w_S1 × NDVI_S1
```

S1 speckle variance is fixed at `0.05² = 0.0025`. A high default variance of `9999` is assigned to pixels with missing S2 data, so the fused output gracefully degrades to the S1 signal only where S2 coverage is absent.

### 🔁 Feature Selection

Nested cross-validation with inner Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) is used to identify a stable feature set:

- **🔄 Outer loop**: GroupKFold (3 splits, grouped by location) — prevents data leakage across plots
- **🔄 Inner loop**: KFold SFS (5 splits) on each fold's training data
- **✅ Stability rule**: Features selected in the majority of outer folds (≥ ⌊n/2⌋ + 1) are retained as the final stable set

### 🤖 XGBoost Hyperparameters

```python
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=300,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    max_depth=3,
    subsample=0.7,
    colsample_bytree=0.7,
    reg_alpha=0.5,
    reg_lambda=1.5,
    min_child_weight=4,
    gamma=0.0,
    random_state=42,
)
```

### 📏 Uncertainty Estimation

Uncertainty is calculated as the standard deviation of out-of-fold residuals (in t/ha), providing empirical 68% and 95% confidence intervals around each prediction:

```
Uncertainty  = std(residuals)
68% CI       = ±1.0  × Uncertainty
95% CI       = ±1.96 × Uncertainty
```
